# Flutter Mobile App

This directory contains a simple Flutter application that replicates the React Native app found in `../app`. It includes Sign In, Home, Transaction Details and Transfer screens with a yellow‑to‑gray‑to‑black gradient background.

`main.dart` bootstraps the app and configures routes.

Run with `flutter run` after installing Flutter.
